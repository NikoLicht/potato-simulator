Potato Simulator
================

Some more info will be available once the project have matured some more. Currently it is a little bit boring.

How to launch
-----------

### With the PotatoSimulator.jar file ###

If the PotatoSimulator.jar already has been compiled (and made sure it's the newest version), then just run  
`git clone https://github.com/iamstalkr/potato-simulator.git && cd "Potato Simulator"`  
`git checkout non-bluej`  
`java -jar PotatoSimulator.jar`

### Without the PotatoSimulator.jar file (or how to compile) ###

On Linux and OS X, type and use the following commands  
`git clone https://github.com/iamstalkr/potato-simulator.git && cd "Potato Simulator"`  
`git checkout non-bluej`  
`jar cmf manifest.txt PotatoSimulator.jar *.*`  
`java -jar PotatoSimulator.jar`  
when you are in the correct directory.
